# **Note**
If after logging in if the series and movies carousel doesn't show up then it means that your local ISP provider has blocked access to this resource. The same thing has happend to me if you are also facing this issue use a vpn to access the data or preferably just change the DNS records as VPN tend to be slower to work with.
