# Frontend Clone of Netflix

Embark on your journey to become a React.js maestro by building your very own Netflix clone! Introducing "Streamflix," a beginner-friendly project that will not only hone your React.js skills but also give you a taste of real-world web development.




## Features Present

    1. Login functionality with firebase.
    2. UI building with React and styling with styled-components.
    3. Movies, Tv-series, etc. data from TMDB API.
    4. Fetching Data with React Query.
    5. Routing with React Router.

## Features missing
    1. Caching of Login State. If you load the website after logging in, the website returns back to the state when no users were logged in.
    2. Not all pages present. You are free to add more routable pages in the application.
## Note

The website is deployed on vercel so when you visit the link you will notice that after you refresh it will show an error page. I don't why this happens on vercel, it may be because of some internal error in their sever. That's all there is I wanted to say, just wanted to point it out.
## Installation

Install my-project with npm

```bash
    cd streamflix
    yarn
```
Run the Client Server

```bash
    yarn run dev
```

## Conclusion
This is not a Full fledged MERN application. I have just limited it to the frontend part but I do have plans to upgrade it in the near future, so stay tuned for that.
